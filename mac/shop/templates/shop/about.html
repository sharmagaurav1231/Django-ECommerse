            <h1 class="display-3">My Awsomekart</h1>
            <p>Awsomekart Pvt Ltd. is an e-commerce company based in Bengaluru, India. Founded by Gourav Sharma
              in 2019, the company initially focused on book sales, before
               expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, and lifestyle products.

                The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] as of March 2017, Awsomekart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[7] Awsomekart is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisitions of Myntra and Jabong.com), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones
                .[8] Awsomekart also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).</p>

              <h2>Fashion On Peak</h2>
              <p>Fashion is a popular aesthetic expression in a certain time and context, especially in clothing, 
                footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle and body proportions.[1] Whereas a trend 
                often connotes a very specific aesthetic expression, and often lasting shorter than a season, 
                fashion is a distinctive and industry-supported expression traditionally tied to the fashion season and 
                collections.[2] Style is an expression that lasts over many seasons, and is often connected to cultural 
                movements and social markers, symbols, class and culture (ex. Baroque, Rococo, etc). 
                According to sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, fashion connotes “the latest fashion, the latest difference.”</p>

              <h2>Great Hospitality</h2>
              <p>Customer service is the provision of service to customers before, during and after a purchase. The perception of success of such interactions is dependent on employees "who can adjust themselves to the personality of the guest".[1] Customer service concerns the priority an organization assigns to customer service relative to components such as product innovation and pricing. In this sense, an organization that values good customer service may spend more money in training employees than the average organization or may proactively interview customers for feedback.</p>

              <h2>Best Review Products.</h2>
              <p>A customer review is a review of a product or service made by a customer who has purchased and used, or had experience with, the product or service. Customer reviews are a form of customer feedback on electronic commerce and online shopping sites. There are also dedicated review sites, some of which use customer reviews as well as or instead of professional reviews. The reviews may themselves be graded for usefulness or accuracy by other users.</p>
